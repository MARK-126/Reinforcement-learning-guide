    "## What is Actor-Critic?\n",
    "\n",
    "Actor-Critic methods use two neural networks:\n",
    "- **Actor**: Learns the policy π(a|s) - what action to take\n",
    "- **Critic**: Learns the value function V(s) - how good is the current state\n",
    "\n",
    "The critic helps reduce variance in the actor's gradient updates by providing a **baseline**.\n",

    "| Aspect | REINFORCE | Actor-Critic |\n",
    "|--------|-----------|---------------|\n",
    "| Learning | Monte Carlo (full episodes) | Temporal Difference (step-by-step) |\n",
    "| Baseline | Fixed or moving average | Learned value function V(s) |\n",
    "| Variance | High variance | Lower variance |\n",
    "| Update Frequency | End of episode | Every step (online) |\n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand the Actor-Critic architecture\n",
